PCK-CNC is an open-source CNC router designed to offer precision, reliability, and affordability. This machine combines high-performance features with an accessible design that caters to both beginners and CNC hobbyists. Its structure is primarily 3D-printed, making it easy to build and modify, while critical components, such as aluminum parts, provide durability and strength. The router has a working area of 750mm x 490mm, making it versatile enough to handle a wide range of projects, from small hobbyist tasks to more professional-grade work.

To achieve good accuracy and reliability, the PCK-CNC utilizes ballscrews and linear rails, delivering superior precision compared to belt-driven systems. It is equipped with an 800W spindle, controlled by a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD), allowing precise adjustments to spindle speed based on the material and cutting requirements. The machine is capable of milling plastics, wood, and aluminum, ensuring it meets the needs of various users and applications.

The PCK-CNC features an integrated electronics system, saving space and making the setup more compact and user-friendly. At the heart of the system is the PCK Controller, an open-source controller designed specifically for this project. It is powered by a 32-bit microprocessor, offering smooth and fast operation, and runs on the open-source grblHAL firmware. This advanced software enables features like Y-axis auto-squaring, which improves repeatability and precision during machining.
The controller operates at 48V to manage higher motor speeds and directly interfaces with the VFD for spindle control. Safety and reliability are also priorities, the controller is galvanically isolated, protecting connected devices and computers from electrical faults. Additionally, it is designed to better withstand electromagnetic interference (EMI), ensuring stable and reliable operation.

One of the standout aspects of the PCK-CNC is its affordability. Despite its advanced features and capabilities, the machine can be built for approximately 1500 USD, making it an excellent choice for makers and hobbyists looking for a high-quality CNC router without a high price tag.
As an open-source project, PCK-CNC is open to collaboration and customization, inviting users to modify and enhance the design to suit their needs. Whether youâ€™re starting your CNC journey or seeking a reliable platform for experimentation, the PCK-CNC provides an accessible and powerful solution for precise and efficient machining.
